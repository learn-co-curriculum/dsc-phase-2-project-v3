![alt text](https://i.redd.it/9n27tczziac01.png)

## Overview

We have been hired by a company looking to break into the movie industry. They have tasked us with determining what types of films are doing the beset and why.

## Key Business Problem

We have decided to present three recommendations based on analysis of the following 

* What are the most successful genres?
* What is an ideal movie runtime?
* What are some successful directors?

## Data Analysis And Understanding

Our goal is providing three recommendations of filmmaking characteristics to best gain profit for the movie studio.

### Source of data

Our sources of data were the IMDb Movie Database, And The Numbers budget data.

Our goals were to extract a return percentage for the categories of movie genre and movie runtime.

In addition we analyzed directors and give several recommendations.

### Description of data

The data can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project-v3)

The primary data used was from the im.db database. The following image below showes the ERD (entity-relationship diagram) of the im.db database.

In addition we used a database from The Numbers which contained movie budgets.
